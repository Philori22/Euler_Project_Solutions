# Euler Project Solutions

## What is Project Euler?
Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just 
mathematical insights to solve. Although mathematics will help you arrive Although elegant and efficient methods, 
the use of a computer and programming skills will be required to solve most problems.

The motivation for starting Project Euler, and its continuation, is to provide a platform for the inquiring mind to delve into unfamiliar areas and
learn new concepts ina  fun an recreational context.

The problems can be found at the following:

## Goal:
The purpose of this is to prractice solving mathematical and computer programming problems. So, basically the solutions for each question will
be implemented in both C++ and Python.
